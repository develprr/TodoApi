# TodoApi
A demo Todo API for .NET based on tutorial at https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-8.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio-code

## Info
I scaffolded this project from Microsoft's dedault template with command
```
dotnet new webapi --use-controllers -o TodoApi
```
which generates the structure for the project from Microsoft's template.

Quite surprisingly, Microsoft's auto-generated API template contains a weather forecast controller by default.

Quite boring, I would have preferred to see a sausage store by default. But on the other hand, why not! :)
